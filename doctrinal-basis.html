			<p>
				The basis of the Fellowship shall be the fundamental truths of
				Christianity, as revealed in Holy Scripture, including:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					There is one God in three persons, the Father, the Son and
					the Holy Spirit.
				</li>
				<li>
					God is sovereign in creation, revelation, redemption and
					final judgement.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Bible, as originally given, is the inspired and
					infallible Word of God. It is the supreme authority in all
					matters of belief and behaviour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Since the fall, the whole of humankind is sinful and guilty,
					so that everyone is subject to God's wrath and condemnation.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Lord Jesus Christ, God's incarnate Son, is fully God; he
					was born of a virgin; his humanity is real and sinless; he
					died on the cross, was raised bodily from death and is now
					reigning over heaven and earth.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sinful human beings are redeemed from the guilt, penalty and
					power of sin only through the sacrificial death once and for
					all time of their representative and substitute, Jesus
					Christ, the only mediator between them and God.
				</li>
				<li>
					Those who believe in Christ are pardoned all their sins and
					accepted in God's sight only because of the righteousness of
					Christ credited to them; this justification is God's act of
					undeserved mercy, received solely by trust in him and not by
					their own efforts.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Holy Spirit alone makes the work of Christ effective to
					individual sinners, enabling them to turn to God from their
					sin and to trust in Jesus Christ.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Holy Spirit lives in all those he has regenerated. He
					makes them increasingly Christlike in character and
					behaviour and gives them power for their witness in the
					world.
				</li>
				<li>
					The one holy universal church is the Body of Christ, to
					which all true believers belong.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Lord Jesus Christ will return in person, to judge
					everyone, to execute God's just condemnation on those who
					have not repented and to receive the redeemed to eternal
					glory.
				</li>
			</ol>
